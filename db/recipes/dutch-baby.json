  "ingredients": [
    "4 tbs unsalted butter",
    "4 lg eggs",
    "1/2 tsp salt",

    "2/3(+)* cup milk",

  "description": "A delightful oven-baked pancake that puffs up beautifully, perfect for breakfast or brunch. Serve with maple syrup and a dusting of nutmeg for a comforting treat.",
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat oven to 450°. While oven is heating, blend*** together eggs and salt. Slowly add flour*, and then the milk*, continuing to blend until smooth. Put butter in a large oven-proof skillet, or stock pot, and melt in oven until lightly browned. Remove from oven, pour batter into center of pot (so it has a better chance of rising evenly), then return to oven. Bake approximately 13-14 minutes, until lightly browned on top - pancake should be puffy and uneven. Remove from oven and dust with freshly grated nutmeg. Cut into pie-shaped wedges, and serve immediately with warmed maple syrup. If it’s snowing, a sprinkling of powdered sugar may also be warranted.",
    {
      "Notes": [
        "* A measure that is slightly shy on the flour but generous on the milk will yield a lighter and puffier baby.",
        "** For 3 people: use 3 eggs, 1/2 a cup of flour & milk, and a little less butter and salt.",
        "*** A wire whisk will also work, if you don’t have a blender."
